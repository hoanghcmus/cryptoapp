This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## 4: Techstack
| Library/Framework | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **redux** | State Management | Manages application state in a predictable way. |
| **redux-persist** | Data Persistence | Persists Redux store data to local storage. |
| **react-query** | Data Fetching & Caching | Manages, fetches, caches, and updates server-side data. |
| **nativewind** + **tailwindcss** | Styling | Allows styling React Native components with Tailwind CSS. |
| **jest** | Testing | A JavaScript testing framework for unit testing. |
| **axios** | Networking | A popular library for making HTTP requests. |

## 5: Highlights 
- **DemoScreen**: Map to **DemoActivity** in Native Android 
- **CurrencyList**: Map to **CurrencyListFragment** in Native Android 
- **Currency Data flow**: `load Local data` for **CurrencyList** => `fetch Backend data` => `update Local data` ==> `reflect Local data change` for **CurrencyList**
- **fetchAllCurrencies**: 
   + **For Android**: Call Native Module to fetch mock data 
   + **For iOS**: Response JS mock data from sample dataset 
- **Other APIs fetch currencies (Crypto | Fiat)**: Response JS mock data from sample dataset 
- **All IO operations**: Run on `Another thread (JS, Worker)` (**not** `UI | Main thred`)
- **Unit test**: Applied for `DemoScreen`, `CurrencyList`, and `api`
